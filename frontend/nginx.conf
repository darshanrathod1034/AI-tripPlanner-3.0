# NGINX Configuration for React SPA
# ============================================
# This config is IMPORTANT for React Router!
# Without it, refreshing a page like /trips/123
# would give a 404 error.

server {
    # Listen on port 80
    listen 80;
    
    # Server name (optional, useful for multiple domains)
    server_name localhost;
    
    # Root directory where our built files are
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    
    # Default file to serve
    index index.html;

    # Handle all routes
    location / {
        # Try to find the requested file
        # If not found, serve index.html (for React Router)
        # 
        # Example: User visits /trips/123
        #   1. nginx looks for /trips/123 file - not found
        #   2. nginx looks for /trips/123/ folder - not found
        #   3. nginx serves index.html - React Router handles it!
